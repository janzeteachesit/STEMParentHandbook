# A STEM Manifesto

We strive to uncover better ways of teaching and learning by doing it and by helping others to do it.

In our journey, we have come to value:

- over 
- over 
- project-focused, extended learning over seperate and distinct content-area classes
- demonstrations and presentations over tests and exams
- making artifacts over seat work

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Principles behind the STEM Manifesto



We follow these principles:

- Our highest priority is to engage students through challenging and thoughtful projects.
- Teachers and students must learn together daily throughout the project.
- Welcome change, even late in the creative process. Adapt to and harness change to strengthen student curiosity.
- A working artifact is the primary measure of progress.
- Complete working artifacts frequently, every couple of weeks to month, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- The best artifacts, processes, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a team is face-to-face conversation.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- At regular intervals, teams reflect on how to become more effective, and adjust behaviour accordingly.
- These principles support a sustainable \_. The teachers and students should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
