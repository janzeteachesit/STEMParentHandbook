Principles behind the Agile Manifesto



We follow these principles:

Our highest priority is to engage students through challenging and thoughtful projects.

Welcome change and adaptation, even late in the creative process. - harness change to reflect student curiosity.

Complete a working artifact frequently, every couple of weeks to month, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

Teachers and students must learn together daily throughout the project.

Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a team is face-to-face conversation.

A working artifact is the primary measure of progress.

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

The best artifacts, processes, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

These principles support sustainable _____. The teachers and students should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
