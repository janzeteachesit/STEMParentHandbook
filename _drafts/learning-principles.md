# Project-based Learning Principles

- [Social Constructivism]()
  1. Everyone is a participant
     - A shared culture and practice exists where everyone contributes, allowing students to contribute different types of expertise.
  3. Learning feels like play
     - Learning experiences are engaging, learner-centered, and organized to support inquiry and creativity.
  7. Everything is interconnected
     - Students can share their work, skill, and knowledge with others across networks, groups, and communities.
- [Situated and Embodied]()
  4. Learning happens by doing
     - Learning is active and experiential. Students learn by proposing, testing, playing with, and validating theories about the world.
  6. Challenge is constant
     - A “need to know” challenges learners to solve a problem whose resources have been placed just out of reach.
- [Iterative]()
  2. Failure is reframed as iteration
     - Opportunities exist for students and teachers to learn through failure. All learning experiences should embrace a process of testing and iteration.
  5. Feedback is Immediate and ongoing
     - Learners receive ongoing feedback on their progress against learning and assessment goals.




> [Game-Like Learning Principles ](https://www.instituteofplay.org/gll-principles): Our work is guided by a set of _7 Game-Like Learning Principles_ that bring together the principles of game design and learning design to make learning irresistible. Below are a series of videos that bring the principles to life, offering a view into the way they are implemented at the NYC public school Quest to Learn. Each video shows how the core design principles of the model become classroom practice, highlighting just some of the ways game-like learning can be effectively used by students and teachers.
